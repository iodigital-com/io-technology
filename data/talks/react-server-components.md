title: React Server Components
summary: React Server Components is an experimental feature being developed by the React team at Facebook. It aims to allow developers to build components that can be rendered on the server and sent over the network to be hydrated on the client side. This approach is different from traditional client-side rendering, where the entire component tree is sent to the client and rendered there. The motivation behind React Server Components is to improve the performance of server-side rendering (SSR) by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be sent to the client. With React Server Components, only the necessary components and data are transmitted, resulting in smaller and faster initial page loads.
