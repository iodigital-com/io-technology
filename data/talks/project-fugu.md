title: Project Fugu
summary: Cross platform development is hard. Each platform as it's own implementation of an API and you end up with separate apps for each platform. Multiple frameworks try to fix this issue by creating an abstract between the platform and the application. Browser vendors are doing the same and it's called Project Fugu. In this talk I explain what it is and what it isn't.
