title: Why LIT is 🔥
summary: 'Every day a new JavaScript library is born, every week a new framework arrives and every month a front-end developer needs to rewrite a date picker 😢 LIT is a modern library for creating component libraries, design systems but also sites and apps. LIT components are web components and as such work anywhere you use HTML.'
