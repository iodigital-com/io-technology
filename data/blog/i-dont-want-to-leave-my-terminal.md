# I Don't Want to Leave My Terminal

The terminal, often called the command line or shell, is a powerful interface for interacting with your computer. While it may appear daunting to newcomers, mastering the terminal can significantly enhance your productivity and open up a world of possibilities. In this article, we'll explore a few handy tools that can be accessed directly from the terminal, providing valuable information and shortcuts for various tasks.

## Cheat Sheets for Tools and Languages

Whether you're a programmer, developer, or system administrator, you often need quick access to syntax, commands, and documentation for various programming languages and tools. `curl cht.sh` offers an extensive collection of cheat sheets, making it easier to find the information you need without leaving the terminal.

To access a cheat sheet, use the following command:

```bash
curl cht.sh/[Tool or Language]
```

Replace `[Tool or Language]` with the name of the programming language or tool you want a cheat sheet for. For example, to get a cheat sheet for Git, use:

```bash
curl cht.sh/git
```

Get information about `aws-cli` or `gcloud`:

```bash
curl cht.sh/aws
curl cht.sh/gcloud
```

You can get language-specific syntax quickly:

```bash
curl cht.sh/go/web-server
curl cht.sh/rust/loops
curl cht.sh/typescript/generic-type
```

There can be many examples since this command will provide concise and relevant information about the language or tool, including commonly used commands, syntax, and examples. If you need assistance or more options, you can use the `:help` feature like this:

```bash
curl cht.sh/:help
```

## Weather Information

Are you curious about the current weather in your city or planning a trip and need to check the forecast? The `curl` command and `wttr.in` can be your go-to tool.

To get the weather information for a specific location, type the following command into your terminal:

```bash
curl wttr.in/[Location]
```

Replace `[Location]` with the name of your city or the location you want to check. For instance, to get the weather in Amsterdam, you would type:

```bash
curl wttr.in/Amsterdam
```

This command will return a detailed weather report, including current conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. If you need help or want to explore additional options, you can use the `:help` feature by appending it to the URL like this:

![Amsterdam weather](/articles/i-dont-want-to-leave-my-terminal/weather.png 'Amsterdam weather')

```bash
curl wttr.in/:help
```

## Cryptocurrency Information

Cryptocurrency markets are known for their rapid fluctuations, and staying updated on the latest prices and trends is essential for traders and enthusiasts. `curl rate.sx` is a handy tool that allows you to retrieve cryptocurrency information directly from the terminal.

To check the price of a specific cryptocurrency on a specific date, use the following command:

```bash
curl rate.sx/[Token]@[Date]
```

Replace `[Token]` with the cryptocurrency symbol or name and `[Date]` with the date you want to check. For example, to get the price of XRP on October 1st, you can use:

```bash
curl rate.sx/btc
curl rate.sx/xrp@2023-10-01
```

![BTC daily chart](/articles/i-dont-want-to-leave-my-terminal/crypto.png 'BTC daily')

This command will provide historical data for the selected cryptocurrency on the specified date.

To seek help or explore additional options, use the `:help` feature as follows:

```bash
curl rate.sx/:help
```
